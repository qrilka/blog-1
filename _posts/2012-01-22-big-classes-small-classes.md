Yeah... Soon I feel I have to start the tag "Anger" for my entries...

Now I work with code... Few days ago I saw the class... One class... Implementation of one (**ONE**!) class is almost 1700 lines of code...

You can curse me, you can kill me, but I'll still repeat: **nothing can excuse programmers who are doing such monstrous classes**. Just think about it - 1700 lines of code! Even if class have a very big responsibility (which in itself is **very** bad), its implementation can be divided into subclasses, functors, etc.

Tell me please: how to persuade programmers not write code like this? Tears? Cries? How?? I don't know...
