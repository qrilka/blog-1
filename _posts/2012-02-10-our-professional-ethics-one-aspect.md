Ethics it's not an abstract blab. Ethics is a set of mandatory principles.

And one of the principles of our ethics is the principle of community. Briefly it can be formulate as: when you do something - think not only about themselves but about others too.

Professional developer follow this ethical principle and write a code that not only solves the specific problem (i.e. code that translated correctly and properly runs), but also:
<ul>
  <li>help his colleagues in their work,</li>
  <li>contributes to the professional level of his colleagues.</li>
</ul>

If your code is clean and consistently reflects your thoughts (thoughts were in your head when you wrote it) - you help your colleagues. You save their time and their nerves (and sometimes do not know what is more valuable), you help to develop this software solutions. And that's why you deserve the respect of your colleagues.

If your code contain a beautiful design solutions (which are used "to the right place and right time") - you help to raise the professional level of your colleagues. You help them become a better developers, and you again get respect you deserve.

Unfortunately, not all programmers follows this ethical principle. Their thoughts are:
<ul>
  <li>"What you do want from me? Code compiles and work properly. I get paid for it."</li>
  <li>"What? Code hard to read? It's not my problem."</li>
  <li>"It's hard to understand? You're lamer, go to learn language better!"</li>
</ul>

Sound familiar? Oh...

In general, let every man will draw conclusions. Let everyone decide whether he is only thinking about themselves or about others as well.
