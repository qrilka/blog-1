The button is probably most obvious element of the GUI. Button is always action, press it - and action will be done. So button's label allways uniquely identifies this action: "Add" - and something will be added, "Save" - and something will be saved, "Open" - and something will be opened. But there is one button's label that is as familiar as unsuccessful: the label "OK".

You know what it means OK? This world famous acronym formed from two words "all correct" written in German style as "oll korrekt". That is OK can be translated as "all right, all correct."

So, whenever you see button "OK", you'll actually see a button that says "all right". Hmm, er... Well, what kind of action will be done when you click on button "all right"? OK is not a verb, nor anything similar to the verb. "All right" is statement, not an action.

In fact, label "OK" doesn't explain what this button do. So label "OK" is bad. It was bad at Windows 95, it is bad for now. I believe label "OK" always can (and must) be replaced by better alternative. **Always**.
